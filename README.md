## Contributing
There are no specific rules for contributing as it is a fairly simple website.

Please fill up issues before creating PRs, and try to link your commits to the specific issues.

You can also help us create milestones by creating issues and proposing milestone plans or discussions.

## Deployment
We currently deploy the website on OVH Object Storage (Openstack Swift Object Storage) with a flat file structure (no directories at all). The project must therefore been built before deployment (using `vendor/bin/robo build`) and the files from the `dist/` directory only are deployed.

The website is served over **https** thanks to Cloudflare that allows us to use a flexible SSL (connection between Cloudflare and the object storage is not secured basically).

Cloudflare also act as a cache on its CDN, so the cache has to be cleared after deployment.
